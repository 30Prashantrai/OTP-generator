The code prompts the user to enter a phone number and generates a random 4-digit OTP (One-Time Password) if the input is a 10-digit number. If the input is not a 10-digit number consisting only of digits, an error message is displayed.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

Import the necessary libraries: random and string.
Prompt the user to enter a phone number using the input() function and store the input in the variable user_input.
Check if the length of the user_input is equal to 10 and if it consists only of digits using the len() and isdigit() methods.
If the condition is satisfied, proceed to generate the OTP.
Create a string of all digits using string. digits and store it in the variable x.
Use the random.choices() function to randomly select 4 digits from the string x and store them in the variable rand_val.
Print the OTP by joining the randomly selected digits using the " ".join() method.
If the condition is not satisfied, i.e., the input is not a 10-digit number consisting only of digits, print the error message.
